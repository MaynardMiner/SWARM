Notes On OC-Configuration: Leave "Cards": "" To not use OC tuning
   Scroll to bottom for HiveOS and Windows AMD instructions.

For Cards: Enter as shown below in "Cards" example P-Model Cards Must Be Specified As Such: P106-100 P106-090 P104-100 P102-100 If you require more p-model cards- Contact Developer.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Obviously the OC-Nvidia.conf file is a huge file. It may be smart to save the blank copy before editing in case you are like me, and are prone to making typos. All { } [ ]" " : , characters must remain in tact, or miner will generate errors!

{ 
  "Cards": "1070 1070 1070 1050ti 1050ti 1050ti 1070 1050ti 1050ti 1070 1070 1050ti 1050ti" 

If you would like swarm to start fans on Windows startup- enter fan in % here:

"windows fan start": "70 70 75 75 70 75 70 70 75 70 70 70 70",


If Cards Is Not Empty: Defaults MUST Be Specified For ALL Cards! You cannot leave blank! "default" is settings used for algorithms left without any oc settings. Have "Cards" set will essentially "turn on" OC-Tuning

"default_NVIDIA1": {
     "Power": "150 150 150 75 75 75 150 75 75 150 150 75 75", 
     "Core": "100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100", 
     "Memory": "1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000" 
     } 

ETHPill for dagger algos:

"ethash": {
    "Power": "150 150 150 75 75 75 150 75 75 150 150 75 75",
    "Core": "100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100",
    "Memory": "1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000",
    "ETHPill": "Yes",
    "PillDelay": "5"
  },


For Algorithms: They are located within each miner.json in the miners folder.
You can choose to leave blank, such as below: If you do, MM.Hash will use "default" settings above.


  "aergo": { 
    "Power": "", 
    "Core": "", 
    "Memory": "" 
   } 


If you wish to only modify power- You MUST specify core and memory as well: "stock" profile is 0


  "aeon": { 
  "Power": "150 150 150 75 75 75 150 75 75 150 150 75 75", 
  "Core": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0", 
  "Memory": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0" } 


If you want to modify core or memory- You MUST modify BOTH, even if you wish to leave at default. "stock" profile is 0. Power could be left empty- but it will be set to the previous algorithm...So The best method is to always specify power to be safe.


  "allium": { 
    "Power": "150 150 150 75 75 75 150 75 75 150 150 75 75", 
    "Core": "125 125 125 100 100 100 125 100 100 125 125 100 100", 
    "Memory": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0" } 


Here is a full example of all three settings in use:


  "balloon": { 
    "Power": "150 150 150 75 75 75 150 75 75 150 150 75 75", 
    "Core": "125 125 125 100 100 100 125 100 100 125 125 100 100", 
    "Memory": "1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000" } 


Note for Previous Windows users: Unix memory settings operate differently: Times your previous windows settings by two to get same settings for unix.

Memory below is +1000, that would be +500 in Windows.


  "bitcore": { 
  "Power": "150 150 150 75 75 75 150 75 75 150 150 75 75", 
  "Core": "125 125 125 100 100 100 125 100 100 125 125 100 100", 
  "Memory": "1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000" } 


These settings can be changed while miner is running. If you are using HiveOS: You WILL not see oc settings applied, there is no api for OC settings

To veiw oc settings remotely- Use 'get-oc' command.


  "blake2s": { 
    "Power": "150 150 150 75 75 75 150 75 75 150 150 75 75", 
    "Core": "125 125 125 100 100 100 125 100 100 125 125 100 100", 
    "Memory": "1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000" } 


Note On 'get-oc' command. OC settings are applied just before miner launch. 'stats' and 'active' are refreshed AFTER miner launch. so depending on what phase of miner launch you are on: they may be different. If they are, wait 20 seconds, and check again to confirm they match.


  "c11": { 
  "Power": "150 150 150 75 75 75 150 75 75 150 150 75 75", 
  "Core": "125 125 125 100 100 100 125 100 100 125 125 100 100", 
  "Memory": "1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000" }


oc-settings are applied during the start of "logdata" screen. The only way to see it operate is to quick swith to the screen when "clearing screen" comes up on MM.Hash.


  "cryptonight": { 
  "Power": "150 150 150 75 75 75 150 75 75 150 150 75 75", 
  "Core": "125 125 125 100 100 100 125 100 100 125 125 100 100", 
  "Memory": "1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000" } 


amd process is the same:


"Cards": "RX580 RX580 RX580 Vega Vega"

"default_AMD1":  {
  "dpm":  "5 5 5 5 5",
  "v":  "950 950 950 1100 1100",
  "core":  "1100 1100 1100 950",
  "memory":  "1099 1099 1099 915 915",
  "mdpm":  "2 2 2 3 3",
  "fans":  "60 60 60 80 80"
}

dpm: Core P-State
v: Core voltage (aggressively set for all p-states)
core: Core Clock
memory: Memory Clock
mdpm: Memory State
fans: Fan speed

-Windows: dpm isn't needed.
-Windows: mdpm will set memory P-Voltage for all states = to default state selected.
