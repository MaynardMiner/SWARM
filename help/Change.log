ChangeLog

1.2.9:

(ALL VERSIONS)
-Added New Zergpool Equihash Algos


(HIVEOS)
-Added 'active' command
 Type 'active' to view active miners in any terminal
-Add 'stats' command
 Type 'stats to view MM.Hash miner stats in any terminal
-Created Help Files Folder
-Log Integration with HiveOS
 Logs are now scheduled to HiveOS logging.
-Added Pools To Main Mining Screen
-Added Previous HashRates To Main Mining Screen
-Cleaned up Main Mining Screen
-Repaired Random Failures Of EWBF Hive Stats

-Added -Benchmark Parameter. Expiremental:

  -Benchmark [seconds]

   If miner hashrate equals $null, -interval time will
change to -Benchmark time. This only works for NVIDIA1.
Other device groups will still mine as usual, but will
have same interval as -Benchmark.

   I did not test fully. Report if it is working correctly
I will update wiki.



1.3.0:

(Windows & HiveOS)

-Zergpool https:/. Better API calls.
-Added Equihash Algorithms - zergpool and mph

(HiveOS)
-Ensured -Benchmark parameter working
-Fixed -Timeouts parameter
-Log rollover every 12 hours. Miner divides logs into 1 hour periods.
-PID read/write for better process control
-Discovered actual Powershell Core bug in (where).count -eq 0. It worked when it wanted to. 
Reported to powershell, and then built workaround.
-Added Cuda-9-2 folder, will start filling with miner files for HiveOS cuda 9.2.
You must setup hiveOS to be able to use Cuda9.2 (Not reccommended)
-Added 10 second wait to give Miners time to spool up. Was noticing occasional lockup becuase
of too high resource use.
-Reduced hashrate display time to every 7 seconds instead of 5 for smoother display.
-Fixed Claymore API. However, noticed Claymore itself was displaying only 1 fan and 1 temp
during my testing occasionally. In future I will attempt to force defaults from Hive when this happens.
-Timeout Folder to notify when miners timeout. However, Timeouts no longer set all hashrates to zero. This
way miner can continue to try to mine that algo/coin. I simply reduces overall daily hashrate. The Timeout
folder will give you an idea of specific stats you may want to delete and then re-benchmark for fine tuning.
-Resolved Status flag issues. When typing "active", you should receive correct data.
-Resolved previous hashrate issues on screen
-Attempted to display better countdown times. NOTE: Internal countdown time varies by processor to processor.
However- Run time displayed for Miners is 100% correct.

1.3.2:

Truncate log stats for T-Rex, so user will know when miner isn't hashing in case MM.Hash fails
Attempted to fix multiple LogData screens
Migrated total t-rex log hash into try/catch argument to prevent on-screen errors (which is normal if hashrate isn't there).
Updated Miners
Migrated into a version setup, with remote upgrading capability- Details on full operation coming soon. (expiremental)
-Force paramter to clear T-Rex log.
updated Z-Enemy
updated T-Rex
Removed -Algorithms, as it was depreciated. Algorithms can now be changed by editing "Algorithms.txt" file
miner will self-install powershell
Added Date to stats command
Updated Help Files
Ensured All Miners Display Pool

1.3.3:

zergpool api updated.
for future implementation- zergpool_coin added
for future implementation- zerpgool_algo added
zergpool removed
blockmasters added (was not tested- Trying to push fast to fix zergpool)
starpool added (tested)
New command- "logdata" lets you see the stats recording miners that work from logs. Debug aid.
New command- "pidinfo" was always running in background- brought it to a screen so you can see MM.Hash process tracking. Debug aid.
LogData screen opens with every miner, is put to sleep if not needed (to preveny zombie app errors)
PIDInfo screens opens with every miner- Has always been running, it is just now visual
PIDInfo is now tracking MM.Hash process- For future implementation.
Added "clear" background process, work the same as miners- Double close command in case of hangs.
Small implementation to reduce resources.
Status flags written to disk, to provide double checking of MM.Hash states and its miners.

1.3.4:
-HiveOS Added hive integrated "mine" command. Enter to bring up NVIDIA1 screen (mining window).
-Added -No_Algo argument. -No_Algo excludes aglorithm of your choice. Must match Algorithms.txt.
Case Sensitive! (All lower case characters)
-EWBF coins added back in. Updated equihash to match zergpool.
-Reduced resources on PID system/tracking, removed read/write status- It was redundant.
-Newer streamlined benchmarking system. (Both versions)
-Better chance of miner catching and recording timeouts.
-Recorded hashrate displayed at benchmarking. Recorded hashrate is pulled from file (accurate).
-Enemy 1.15a
-CryptoDredge 0.8.3
-Started staging of much faster -Auto_Coin version. Not implemented yet.
-Started staging for T-Rex API Rest method hashrate recording (when implemented).


1.3.7 HiveOS Silver Lambo Edition:
-IMPROVED COIN MINING SYSTEM! Highly recommend to try -Auto-Coin "Yes"
-MM.Hash will not sort or download entire database, miner first sorts by most profitable algorithms, if the best pool is pool that has the capability of selecting a coin other than BTC: IT then chooses the coins of the algorithms of that pool.
-Stats will show coin list of a particular algorithm if coin mining occurs during that period.
- -Auto Coin switching is now around a 20-30 second process: which is 200% better.
-Fixed Powershell Core update bugs with a better workarounds.
-MM.Hash in background checks stats for possible timeouts, for accurate timeouts.
-MM.Hash now closes itself and all background windows within a few seconds of it stopping.
-Added -threshold argument default (internally) is set to .1 - If profit day shows to be .1 btc: MM.Hash ignores algo.
-Added back & improved active times for miners.
-Staged miners.txt. Does not work. However, you can see the direction it is going.
-This is beta version of new system.
-CPU Miners will now compile to your system. I included an experimental one that can work for ARM cpus. Note- Initial benchmark period is usually long for cpuminers. I would turn up -interval when benchmarking them. After initial benchmarks, you can set -interval to a much lower setting.
-hex added to algorithms.txt and files.
-fixed blockmasters pool file.
-fixed starpool pool file.
-pools initial stats are now estimate current. 24 hours was causing irregular initial stats. Improved 'stats' command and display.
-Enemy 1.16 added
-Code Staging for AMD

1.3.8
Important: -GPU_Count1 argument was removed. Miner now detects GPU's. You will get errors if used.
-Upated Windows Version To New Coin Switching System (Windows Miner Down- Could Not Test. Converting it to AMD rig. Please Report Bugs)
-Added -Favor_Coins argument. Default is "Yes"
-Combined Windows and Linux Miners into one folder sharing same files.
-Added Config Folder- Placed algorithms files there.
-Added \Config\update.txt
-Due to miner files being combined, you will have to benchmark. However, future updates will no longer your miner files. They will be copied over.
-Ensured T-Rex accepted/rejected are shown correctly on HiveOS.
-Lots of Code-Staging/Prep for AMD mining. Did not add AMD miners (having to change a lot to make it happen).
-Updated Algorithms and their placements to most optimal settings. Should see better hashrates on miners.
-Removed Alexis-Miner. It's depreciated
-Remove ocminer. It's depreciated
-Fixed threshold issues (will test further to confirm).
-Worked on better miner launch sequence
-Fixed myr-gr
-Added algorithms in case pools add them

1.3.9
-Fixed GPU array from double loading GPU index
-Removed extra pool files from github CoinPools folder
-Ensure -Favor_Coins was working.
-Miner will overwrite 1.3.8 versions, but transfer your miner configurations.
-Re-wrote benchmark parameter to test bench before writing stat, will write
message if testbench fails
-Failed Benchmarking should now require 3 failed benches in a row order to write
stat to 0
-Fix T-Rex Hive monitoring: Hashrates will now display correctly for each gpu.
-Added Sonoa
-Started Migration of cmdlets from main source code. Added some notations. Not
finished yet.

-Ensure 100% benchmarking is setting to 0 after 3 failed attempts
-Fixed some HiveOS stat issues from 1.3.9
-Updated Z-Enemy to latest version
-Noticed Times Were inconsistent on "active" screen: Attempted fix
-Removed Erroneus Messages involving closing screens (now that I know it works consistently)
-pidinfo now starts at miner startup, MM.Hash will always close within 5 seconds of it being stopped.
-Started code staging for windows HiveOS API 2.0 (not completed) integration
-Started code staging for HiveOS new version 1.4.0b
-Started code staging for Ubuntu new version 1.4.0c

1.4.0b
HiveOS: Changes:
-Added AMD miners, and changed code to work for AMD in HiveOS (HiveOS only)
-AMD miners are not plug-and-play. You will likely have to edit settings in the miner files, AMD Unix is complicated, but you should be familiar with this.
-Will add more/fine AMD miners- This is simply beta test of core script. Please use and review any issues you see.
-SGminer is not working on blockmasters- It is a pool issue, not miner.
-Fixed stats and have background miner logs sent to "Logs" folder
-Reduced switch load time by a few seconds.
-New Remote command: get-screen [type]...Show last 100 lines of group1 miner on HiveOS site.
-Ensured Timeouts will timeout miners.
-Added Function Restart-Database. Miner will now switch off algorithm/coin if detects no hash after 1 min.
-Times on 'active' command should be more accurate.
-'active' now shows database countdown.
-code staging for Ubuntu version.
-added more algorithm text files that are case specific for naming convetions between pool and miner.
-Enemy 1.1.7
-T-Rex 0.6.2 (added balloon)
-Lots of migrations and code cleanup to make miner better/faster
-Fixed "Logs" error from beta
-Fixed T-rex from beta
-Removed algorithms.txt. It was redundant. Main algorithm list is get-pool.txt...Just remove/add there. get-pool.txt is the
algorithms miner searches for from pools.
-added -SGDevices1 -SGDevices2 -SGDevices3 arguments

1.4.1b beta:

HiveOS Changes:

DISCLAIMERS: 
-I added auto-updates back in, but made it case specific for this release. It may be a good idea to save old miner file settings before updating just in case of failure.
-I made a lot of changed to AMD side, including adding a new system for recording hashrate. Watch and report.
-I made changes to HiveOS stats watch and report
-Avermore does not seem to work in blockmasters for me.
-TDXminer does not seem to work in nicehash for me.
-Claymore works normally, but screen loading is slow for logging (get-screen command)
-To get GPU count for AMD- I am using a different method that I do for NVIDIA. Please let me know if it is displaying correct GPU count. I only have 1 GPU to test.

-Added 0.3.4 Dredge
-Ensured get-screen was working correctly
-removed coin name from "stats". This allows it to clearly show up on HiveOS site.
-Fixed h-stats and commands so I don't accidentally mess up path to commands again.
-Moved khs value to logdata for trex, so Hive will still recieve stats, even when database starts.
-Code staging to remove double local api calls from miners (MM.Hash will send data to h-stats, not both gather information from miner)
-Found some typos of new version- fixed.
-Miner should transfer miner files: Note previous typo on Enemy-CCDevices 2 file You might copy file from github to change) to prevent errors.
-More code staging for Unix version
-Previous Version notes: Poly takes more than 5 minutes to hash an accepted share on lower-model GPUS. You may want to -No_Algo it.
-Confirmed it is possible to combine AMD & NVIDIA, but not possible to get them both to stat on HiveOS (only 1 Device group will work).
-Added tdxminer & new system record hashrate with no api.


1.4.2b beta:

HiveOS version

DISCLAIMERS:
-New t-rex miner gets lower end cards hot for me! watch temps.
-AMD miners currently only work for AMD1 (no grouping yet). NVIDA1 work in groups, but only Group1 sends stats to Hive.
-You CAN run a second instance of MM.Hash on computer if you are using hybrid miner AMD/NVIDIA. Message me for more details if interested. Will create
wiki: It will have to be done through unconventional means.
-lyclMiner is a miner that has no api, and cannot be launched via arguments. Its process for launching/stat tracking is expirmental. I'm over here
working miracles to get these AMD miners that are profitable...Like wth is with AMD miner/programmers?
-all miner files were changed to reflect new stats system (launching/starting) for weird AMD miners.
-Made huge attempts to make stats going to hive more smoother.
-Reduced read/writes to file (Compressing information to singular files)
-Tweaked Monitoring system
-Do not reccommend changing/tweaking miner files or removing stats while miner is running. Could cause issues, due to new process of AMD launching.
-I have only 1 AMD GPU. I believe the hashrate Logging for AMD is correct for each miner, but I have no verifiable proof to know if it working for more
than 1 GPU. I'm going to purchase another AMD card, as these miners are making AMD semi-profitable again.

-New argument -CPUThreads sets -t parameter of CPU miners.
-Cryptozenny is now logging tracked rather than api to prevent benchmarking wait-times.
-Miners now are instance based, should help with Process tracking, and make zombies irrelevant to it.
-Update now has "minername" parameter, which is the name of the executable of the miner. This means you should be able to load your own links in by just changing "minername", if you need to.
-Did lots of benchmarking to reflect new miners- moved around algorithms.
-Axed MSFT difference between MSFT and Tpruvot was marginal for HMQ1725, and Tpruvot is more stable.
-Updated Cryptodredge to latest version (see updatelinux.txt)
-Updated T-Rex to latest version (see updatelinux.txt)
-Minor changes to text on screen for user aid
-Because of all the background logging- Increased Sleep time before stats on screen to 20 seconds, and interval of stats on screen to 15 seconds.
-Changed h-stats.sh to help with the amount of background logging.
-Changes to core script for tracking, code staging for API (API.ps1). Preliminary tests show it is working.

1.4.4b:

-Fixed a typo that prevented possible clearing of content.
-Utilized screen logging with a slight dely to reduce further resources.
-Edited launch timing sequence: May appear slower, but am just giving more time for process to start: No increased delays.
-Updated Crytpodredge
-Updated Enemy
-Code Staging For *nix version
-Added versions in updatelinux.txt (future use: remote command to check miner versions/change links/name.)

1.4.5b:

-Patch for pool data overload.

1.4.6b [and c]

DISCLAIMERS:

This version requires updating drivers to 396
Did not get to fixing anything on AMD side. Still working on it.

There is going to be no c version. b version should now work in Ubuntu:

-download/clone MM.Test (beta version).
-run install.sh as root : sudo ./install.sh. This will install all bash commands.
-open/edit StartMM with your specified arguments.
-Launch MM.Hash (Not as superuser!) ./StartMM
-Operates just like Hive-OS version, just open a new terminal and type desired command.
-requires 396 drivers for nvidia. Have not tested AMD yet.
-requires 'screen' to operate.


-fixed typo in claymore files [-3333]
-added new 'version' command. Will update wiki on use.
-added new 'clear_profits' commmand. Will update wiki on use.
-change nvidia launch to make Hive version work in Ubuntu.
-added install filed for ubuntu install. (used instead of h-run.sh)
-added StartMM, which is the executable to launch ubuntu version.
-added 'benchmark' command.
-updated all miners to cuda 9.2
-changed how updating in MM.Hash works.
-fixed equihash-btg for mph.
-'get-screen' will now get MM.Hash transcript (miner)
-Logs updated to show active log.
-New export folder contains cuda 9.2 library.
-Added CUDA 9.2 libs so ccminers can be recompiled now and used
-Added krnlx-xevan back in for another xevan miner if users want to test. Heard reports it
was faster than enemy.
-Added some more visual aids.
-Removed Algorithm from stats screen. "currently mining is set to print algorithm" at bottom.

1.4.7b:

Disclaimers

Since github repo is changing: Links are dead on screen until I complete
full transision of repo.

-MM.HASH is now "SWARM"
-MM.Hash wiki is not updated, but is still relevant.

Changes:
-Repaired Small Typos
-Add -Force to Timeouts
-Made another attempt to fix timeout benchmark bug (still works fine for me, though)
-Updated miners to recent releases.

New Arguments:

-Cuda
Default is 9.1, so you do not need to add if using 9.1
If you wish to use Cuda 9.2 miners: Add -Cuda 9.2 argument to launch

-HiveOS
Default is "Yes"
If you are using HiveOS, argument is not needed.
If you are running a different OS, it must be added: -HiveOS NO

If you wish to use on a Unix OS other than hive:
run:
sudo ./install.sh
Note: You may have to edit ./install.sh depending on flavor
edit 'swarm' in main directory with your arguments
launch miner by 
./swarm

-New OC-Tuning read "Sample-OC-Nvidia.conf" in config folder to see how to set up.
-Increase donation .05% to reflect additions/new options.
-Updated LISCENSE
-Code-Staging For New ASIC version.

-Added Cuda 9.1 Libraries (in case hive libraries fail again)


1.4.8b

Disclaimers: 

I changed unix miner files in attempt to fix the reported
bug of miners not downloading. I disabled remote updates due to this.

Blockmasters Poolname changed, and has been removed as coinpool.

-New Auto_Coin design:
 -miner now loads top coin from every coin pool for every selected algo.
 -Favor_Coins No will factor Algos + Coins from coin pools.
 -Favor_Coins Yes will always select coins from coin pools.
 -I reccommend using -Auto_Coin Yes, if you are unsure of it- Select
  Favor_Coins No. Miner will only switch to coins if it is higer than
  all api/status algorithms.

-New Arguments
  -StatLevel removed
  -Stat_Algo added [Minute_5] [Minute_10] [Day] [Week]
  -Stat_Coin added [Minute_5] [Minute_10] [Day] [Week]

-Added -Force command to all read-writes to ensure no access denied errors.
-Re-Wrote "WebRequest" cmdlet to new powershell language in attempt to fix bug reports.
 I cannot replicate bug reports, so having issues determining cause. (if it is SWARM related or OS).

New Beta Feature:
Coin-Server
 -launch in terminal (non-remotely) while in SWARM directory "pwsh coin-server.ps1"
 -coin server will update coin data every minute- If works well, will add hashrate data as well,
  and replace coin equations in miner altogether: It will just pull from coin-server. Will likely
  integrate api as well.
 -feature is beta. If you use, please monitor, and report errors or high load increases.

-more code staging for asic.
-started code staging for new windows version. (match HiveOS version)

-Beta version for new coin system. Bugs may be present. Please report so they can be fixed asap.
 Currently regarded as stable from 48 hours of testing.

1.4.9b
Disclaimers:

Miner Files were added/modified. Remote Update Versions Were Disabled Again.
Transferring you oc-tuning file will cause no issues.

-Added lolminer for AMD. Added for NVIDIA version, but stored in "project" folder in miners. Just
 move to "unix" folder to use.

-Other SGMiners do NOT work for all AMD cards. See their github/bitcointalk thread.
-Other SGMiners may require a knowledge/expertise of sgminers to use.
-Depending on your system, you may need to compile these sgminers yourself
-Please DEAR GOD someone find an sgminer dev that knows how linux work!
-My Github is filled with sgminers I had to repair to work in unix environment. They work
 For My RX580- I can't make any gurantees they work for other cards. That's why I moved them
 Out Of Main Folder

XMRig:
-In order to properly parse stats --Nocpu argument was use. HiveOS custom miners
 do not allow for stats of multiple platforms.

 1.5.0b:

 DISCLAIMERS:

 DO NOT USE -Auto_Algo ARGUMENT! IT HAS BEEN REMOVED.

activates watt detection at benchmark. Not stable for larger rigs!
-Miner Now Calculates Power
-power.conf is for manual entries- enter as watts total. Will create helpme soon.
-if WattOMeter is no: miner will defer to power.conf. It should be okay to leave blank-
 I reccommend at least setting a default based on your power limit.

Disclaimers:
-WattOMeter feature causes increased load. Use with discretion with multiple platform use.
-OCTuning feature causes increased driver load. Use with discretion with multiple platform use.
-New Core Program! Front end looks same, backend totally different!
-I have read that using the method to oc tune I use on windows side +
msi afterburner will cause crashes.
-I was having stability issues with NVIDIA miners on windows side-
100% positive it was the miners themselves. I haven't used windows in awhile for tuning them.
-Set a shortcut to startup, and miner will restart at reboot.
-Last rebooot time for windows may be wrong (will fix).
-Load is by % on windows.
-Platform Windows argument must be specified.
-Did not do API for lolminer- Have no pool to test it.
-Cryptodredge threads API for me was timing out a lot. If you experience the same-
message developer.

-Changed logdata screen to 'background'
-background screen shows relevant stat information going to hive (like agent-screen).
-Miner automatically parses -GPUDevices(1,2,3)
-Removed all other -Devices arguments, they are now depreciated
-Not all AMD miners will work with -GPUDevices: They're flawed design, not mine.

-zergpool removed.
-benchmark command now remove power files for wattometer as well. (if using)

1.6.2



Disclaimers:

Dagger does not work on NLPool- leaving it miner regardless in case it does. It's
a good test for new timeout system.
This is mainly update for NVIDIA, and small bug fixes. AMD update coming soon.
Some miner files were changed, so was stat system. Probably ideal to fresh install.
CryptoDredge did not release a cuda 10.0 version of his miner
only cuda 9.1 and 9.2. If you use -cuda 10 and want to use
his new miner- You have to manually update.
CryptoDredge was updated.
Cnv2 added for NVIDIA
To reset bans- run benchmark [algorithm]

-New Argument -Rejections
-Default is 20 (Do not need to specify if you like 20)
-Rejections is the amount of % rejections in order to consider a bad benchmark/strike
-Only flaw to this system, is if rejections are too high: It deletes stat
and forces benchmarking, so pool ban can be enforced.
-Higher the number, the lower chance of enforcement. 100 is maximum.

-New Strike system for benchmarking
-miner no longer sets any stat to 0
-results in more accurate stats.
-strike 1: Notifications
-strike 2: Algorithm ban on said pool
-strike 3: Algorithm ban across all pools
-resets every [x] hours where [x] is -timeout argument

-Ensure stats are cleared before each miner
-prevents cross stat contamination

-Stats will default to 1.000 on HiveOS
-allows user to know miner is running,
but API is awaiting stats.

-Watchdog does not closes down main program (hiveos)
-prevents shutdown of new restarted instance

-Changed ccminer api
-reduces chances of timeouts on SWARM.
-background first gets summary for total HashRates.
-background then tries to get threads.

   This is a beta version.

   FRESH INSTALL MANDATORY
   Linux Version ONLY

   -Wrote small help article for AMD users in help files.

   -Fixed Clamore -Platform issue (AMD)

   -Added argument -OnboardCard. Default is no. Specify Yes if 
    using amd and rocm-smi detects integrated card. Quick fix
    will find better fix in near future

   -re-wrote config folder. config now contains miner control
    files in json format. Adding commands, difficulty, oc
    and pre-start commands are now done there.
 
   -added install git for CPU compiling.

   -Fixed $RAW=0 placement to prevent double stacking of
    hashrates, when total API failure occurs.

   -Converted all config files to json for future use.

   -Changed all miner files for new OC tuning.

   -Changed stats file to come before miner launch.

   -Ensured background agent is started before -delay
    so users can specify delay for OC tuning.

   -OC tuning is now launched in their own screens.
    OC_NVIDIA is for NVIDIA
    OC_AMD is for AMD
    This prevents lockup of any of SWARM's processes
    And lets users check for oc issues.

   -Miners now lauch from one single script, made
    on demand: startup.sh.

   -trex updated, x22i added.

  1.6.7

  There are still beta features in this release.

   folder was deleted- Bans would not
   reset unless restarted. Both -Timeout argument and 
   benchmark timeout commands should now work.

Bleeding Edge is now supported and working.

Because of Bleeding Edge- SWARM cannot restart
agent. You may have to manually restart agent
yourself to update h-stats version.

Type ASIC now in initial test stages. Currently
only have Linux version (not HiveOS). I will
create a write-up on how it works. I was side-lined
with ASIC due to the crazy amount of miner updates/new algos.

     platform will often mine the same algo.
    -WE ARE THE SWARM!

``-Switch_Threshold``
     -Default is ``1`` (for testing)
     -This allows a threshold requirement
      in order to initiate a switch.
     -Figure is percent based.

discord.


1.8.2


-This fixes ``-SWARM_Mode`` parameter and
 millisecond bug.
-SWARM_Mode should work as intented.

New Command (Windows)!

``ps``
  -ps allows you to run powershell/cmd based commands remotely.

   will put your rig offline, just like HiveOS version. You can start
   processes, but use powershell's ``Start-Process`` cmdlet.
  -example:  ``ps Get-Process`` will get you a list of running
   processes on pc.

-Updated trex
-Fixed background miner versions.
-RTX series USB-controller fix. (Stats correct number of GPU's)

This release is mainly a patch for users interested in SWARM_Mode.


1.8.4

Major Changes:

NOTE: FRESH INSTALL HIGHLY SUGGESTED! Beta version from all
the changes/additions.

-Statics have been compeletly rebuilt. 
  -Pool files were all modified,
  -Most of every databasing function has been rewritten.
  -Taking a new, completely my design approach to profit statistics.
  -Taking workers, fees, and pool hashrates into accout- Beyond simple estimates.
  -Entirely new profit equation.
  -Returns seem to be more exact, especially when stat_algo day is used. (but live seems to be best).
  -System is improved, but more changes to account for SWARM_Mode will be made.

-Custom Yiimp Miner Pools
  -You can now create your own mining pool files
  -Instructions on how to create them included in sample file:
    .\algopools\custom.ps1
  -It's as easy as filling out a small 10 question form.
  -Can be duplicated, but same pool duplication not advised.
  -Rename custom.ps1 to bsod.ps1, and you should add a lyra2vc0ban coin
  -Requires wallets for coins- No Auto-Exchange.
  -Useful for testing profitibility of coins outside auto-exchange pools.

-API server now established:
  -http://localhost:4099/summary will get you swarm pricing data
  -http://localhost:4099/getstats will get you mining data
  -Much more is coming soon- Full API method to modify SWARM will exist
  -Sample API for demonstration is included: Sample-API.ps1
      note: As I update API, I will add how to use via Sample-API.ps1
  -Currently this is local, until I finish. I plan to make remote.

-New Arguments:
   -AMDPlatform was removed. Use CLPlatform instead, only if needed.
    Swarm should detect.
   -API: Default is yes, if you have issues, you can remove it its
    by specifying -API No
   -Nicehash_Wallet(1,2,3) no longer needed, however, you can still specify.
   -NiceHash_Fee set to default of 2% if using Nicehash_Wallet, 5% if not (per site).

-Time Syncronization:
  For better SWARM_Mode optimization, all swarm apps will Sycronize
  their time with NIST servers at start.

-Adminstrator
  SWARM now runs in administrator mode. This allows the following:
    -more GUI manipulation.
    -Modify time settings.
    -Launch miners with admin privelages (it helps amd side).
    -modify registry entries for Vega Soft Powerplay Tables.
    -in future: modify registry for gpu optimizations users may
     not be aware of.
    -in future: remotely update NVIDIA/AMD drivers with single command.
    -``ps`` can not run applications as admin
    -ensure security settings are good on your windows computer/network.

-Agent rebuild
  -Rebuilt agent to better gather api stats from miners.
  -Rebuilt C++ software to better gather api stats from GPU drivers.
  -Removed as much error generation as I could possibly find (when API fails).
  -background no longer closes, but still octunes when switch occurs. (within a few seconds).
  -GPU stats are gathered from hive stats file, no gpu api is used.
  -Rebuilt linux api gpu stat generation.
  -Rebuilt windows api gpu stats generation.
  -Rebuilt most of the api's for each miner.
  -Focused on lowered mem use, and resource uses...However more things
   are happening in background, so there should be no change.
  -There is a table corruption in .\odvii.exe. This is an AMD driver bug.
   I cannot fix, but it doesn't seem to cause issues. It just creates error logs
   in windows event veiwer.

-New miners
  -bminer added
  -zhash & Phoenix Miner API are fixed (I believe).
  -warning: Miniz was giving me issues.
  -warning: ccmineryescrypt, cryptodredge, fancyIX,
            wildrig on certain algos may cause issues.
  -warning: Some AMD gpu's may not run all AMD miners.

-Bus statistics fixed.
  -Better GPU detection.
  -Windows now automatically detects OpenCL Platform
     note: This was working for me. Please let me know
     if you have issues.
  -Does not count GPU's that SWARM isn't using
     note: This was working for me. Please let me know
     if you have issues.
  -Removed NVIDIA integrated motherboard cards from count.

-Minimized
   -All windows are either ran hidden/minimized except main
    window.
   -Windows will now set their own colors for visualization
    optimizations.

-Crash reporting
   -If miner is restarted- SWARM detects this, and will
    perform an crash report.
   -Crash reports takes a "flashed image" of all debugging
    data located txt folder, which accounts for 75% of SWARMs
    internal statistics.
   -This data is unchanged, which means you can review incidents,
    what miners were running, etc., to determine failures. Or send
    me the crash report, and let me figure it out.

-Miners Updated

-Gui fixes everywhere. Attempted to remove as many erroneous powershell
 errors/warnings as possible.

-Lots, and lots, and LOTS of small fixes. Too many to detail.
 

1.8.5

NOTE: Windows user can run get update to remote update. This will
be first working instance of it, and it deletes old version folder
in original directory. You may want to make a backup of it first.

NOTE: I am having a hard time with setting SWARM to startup in
windows. Windows blocks the .bat file if added to startup. You have
to add the new file path yourself. I am working on fix.

NOTE: Windows updated in order- 1.8.3 to 1.8.4, 1.8.4 to 1.8.5, etc.

-WildRig Updated
-CryptoDredge Updated
   Note- CryptoDredge algos were removed. A fair amount.
         I didn't code automatic removal on your old files.
-nicehash eq to eu
-small 'tweaks' to profit calc.
-cpu only stats table in agent.
-overdrive api (new version) was not working
 the program was corrupted. I reverted back to original.
 this means no fans/stats for Vega on windows. :(
-watt/day will only show if you have watt values.
-attempted fix for better XMR-STAK stats.
-Increased actual miner ban count to six- meaning 3 bad algo
 runs, and it is banned.
-fixed AMD temps/fans for HiveOS.
-Small Gui fixes with commands.
-Fixed Sgminer stats for good (I think).
-Rolled back vega support for windows. Sorry. It still works, just
 fans and temps won't stat.
-Small tweaks to XMR-STAK/XMRIG api.
-Added lolminer for zhash (AMD).
-Removed tpruvot- Depreciated.
-Added more GUI notations.

1.8.6

Critical X16r patch for 1.8.5

1.8.7 (Not Released)

-Windows version will start connection to HiveOS as soon as first
 agent window starts.

-Fixed commmand ``get benchmarks`` to show only benchmarks.

-Made it so that if command fails- It will not display old commands (Windows).

-Agent message spacing is cleaner

-SWARM_MODE was causing an issue with "Becnhmark Miner" command- It was resolved.

-Agent will now build empty stats array if SWARM is not running (Windows).
 This allows you not to have to wait for miners to download to connect flightsheet.

-Fixed API stats so it is all in KHS (include making decimal for Sol/s).

-Found Issue with multiple device groups not sending total hash to API- resolved.

-Noticed some incorrect hash units being sent to HiveOS (khs was mhs, etc)- resolved.

-SWARM will remotely notify you if there is no miners available (argument/pool/miners issues).

-Migrated More Output files to .\build\txt instead of bash folder. (Helps with debugging).

-SWARM will not remove its tar.gz download for HiveOS.

-SWARM will now copy over last known miner logs into crash-reports.

-SWARM will clean Trash folder for HiveOS (remove old miners/downloads).

-Much better organization of API/summary. Organized by type, then profits (or pool estimates if no benchmarks).

-Lite Mode disables timeout system (so you can run, and it won't block miner stats).

-Removed API-Sample.ps1, will add back when I am finished (Still changing it).

-Added ``-Remote`` parameter, for making API remote.

-Added ``-APIPassword`` parameter, to set a password endpoint on remote api.

-Upadated Help_File with new arguments.

-Increased miner ban to 12 count default (because of zergpool equihash).

-Zergpool Added. Equihash Algos fixed. (I was having trouble with some on zergpool).

-KW/h cost can now be set hourly by power.json, for variable rates. If use in conjucntion
 with ``-Conserve Yes`` argument, you can effectively stop mining if values drop to negative.

-Moved Custom pools to custompools directory. Swarm will check that folder now.

1.8.9

-API now runs through background screen.
-API with windows closes 1 second after background screen exit.
-New default configs (if new are developed) will automatically be added to windows flight sheet.
-Fixed CryptoDredge Download.
-Fixed SWARM re-download on reboot.
-Rolled back deletion of tar.gz from hive downloads folder.
-Windows NVIDIA should now oc with default all GPU's (not just per card)
 If you have only 1 value set.
-API summary table loads faster.

-Rebuilt version command from scratch. It should work decent now.
-version update command should work for regular *nix users, but
 it will not restart SWARM (Working on restart commands).
-version command is new, and is beta- report if issues.


1.9.0

-Windows by default will add itself to startup. (``-Startup No`` to disable).
-Added new algos on zergpool (trex).
-Fixed Version command issues on linux side.
-Slowed the update process down on Windows side: It appears to resolve issues.
-Added -i 12.5 to ccminer yescrypt algorithms.
-Updated gminer links. Moved gminer back into production.
-Whalesburg Pool added (please let me know how your returns factor in comparison to nicehash).
-clear_watts command added- resets power.json.
-clear_profits now works in windows.
-miner restart now works in windows.
-``get wallets`` displays altwallets.
-zergpool added to wallet list.
-New arguments
   ``-Eth`` Eth wallet address
   ``-Worker`` Used where worker is needed (Whalesburg pool).
   ``-Startup`` Default "yes". Adds SWARM to windows startup.
-Select only single Process ID for miners that run multiple processes. (linux)
-gminer API fixed.
-configs for equihash miners (- instead of --) fixed.
-new miner esshand/ccminer for windows/linux
-added algorithms to lolminer.
-wallet table now is shown as decimal instead of scientific notations.

1.9.1

Note: cuckoo will not work for lower-end cards.
Note: Suggested AMD drivers for Windows: 18.6.1.
Note: It is highly advised for linux users to 410.93 drivers.

-zjazz bitcash added.
-argon2d miner for AMD added.
-xmrig updated
-new api command: /getbest
-found/fixed typo for default claymore_amd file for Ethash.
 affected fresh install or users that did not remote update.
-was getting stability issues from a claymore/phoenix miner export. 
 Removed it.

 1.9.2

 -Zjazz multiplier fixed for pool vs. miner. You may want to rebenchmark it.
 -Note: Solution was discussed on handling MTP. Will have something next release.

-``version update`` command can be ran with 'source' rather than
   uri, allowing users to update miners from swarm repository.
   example: 
   ``version update gminer miner 1.21 source``

-gminer 1.21
-Ehssand for AMD.
-added glt token algos to wildrig.
-bminer 13.0 updated & added to windows.
-added 1445 back to bminer.
-API watchdog start first, then server.


1.9.3

Note: With new -No_Algo1,-No_Algo2,-No_Algo3 arguments
      you will be able to divide rig, allowing smaller
      number of gpus to mine algos like mtp and cuckoo.
      This allows larger rigs to still be able to mine
      algorithms.

Example: ``-Type NVIDIA1,NVIDIA2 -GPUDevices1 0,1 -GPUDevices2 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 -No_Algo2 mtp,cuckoo``
          The above example: GPU 0 & 1 will factor mtp and cuckoo, Remaining GPUS will not.

Note: Huge change in miner files. Windows users: z-enemy stats may not transfer over.
      Linux users- No miner stats may transfer over on update.
      Miner filenames were changed to enforce simplistic Uniformity- It had to be done
      eventually.

Note: Update to fix glt-astralhash for wildrig will work.

-Noticed small bug in version command. Works as intented,
 but windows version posted to hiveOS too soon before was finished.
-Fixed powershell bug -ne was failing for zjazz stats.
-Added ``-No_Miner`` argument. See help file for use.
-Uniformity of all miner names.
-``No_Algo`` argument has been removed.
-Added ``-No_Algo1`` argument. See help file for use.
-Added ``-No_Algo2`` argument. See help file for use.
-Added ``-No_Algo3`` argument. See help file for use.
-gminer 1.22
-xmrig removed from rotation, as XMR-STAK now has dual threads

Note: First time users may notice profit calculations are
different compared to other available mining applications.
This is intentional- My method of calculation is different,
and has been discussed at length and supported by userbase.

Note: ``-SWARM_Mode Yes`` allows all SWARM users to switch at same
time. All rigs/users will be syncronized. This does not
apply to pool or choice of miner- Just switching times.

1.9.4

-Algo/Pool specific prohibition.
   -users can turn "off" algorithms on certain pools.
   -to turn "off", add the pool name to "config\pools\pool-algos.json"
   -instructions are inside the .json itself.
-Found typo for ehssand amd minername
-rewrote entire ADL for windows AMD, stats will match correct GPU.
 fan % will match. temp will work correctly. Vega works.
 note about vega/amd cards: reported fan speeds are based on maximum
 rpm, which is gathered from ADL/vbios. Some manufacturers have incorrect
 fan speed, resulting in incorrect fan %. If you wish fixed- Report to manufacturer.
-Code staging for ADL oc and autofan
-Fixed xmr-stak stats to display summary hashrate faster.
-Added energiminer for windows
-``ps`` command will now wait until process finishes, and should work correctly.
-Miner Logging for background miners is a little better in windows
-Windows users can run ``nvidia-smi`` remotely.
-Small tweaks to profit table.
-Moved ports on all nebutech miners to help with benchmarking.

-HiveOS OC for AMD in windows.
   -Read config\oc\new_sample.json on how it works.
   -It is not the same as linux OC.
   -Drivers MUST be at least 19.1.1
   -Advised to install 18.6.1 driver,
    then update (without clean install / install over)
    if this is not done- some miners may fail.
    to 19.1.1

-Windows will now generate a swarm-start.bat file in
 each miner folder in .\bin
    -This allows you to test miners with
     swarm settings.
