Changelog

  2.3.9

  NEW FEATURES!

  SMOS Support:

  https://github.com/MaynardMiner/SWARM/wiki/SMOS-Install

  -Fixed Log Cylcing Issues.
  -Windows: Fixed Bus Sorting of GPUs.
  -Fixed ``version update`` command
  -Fixed ``get parameters`` command for Windows (was showing arguments.json always).

  -Notification Miner Port is being cleared on screen (linux).
  * SWARM will wait until miner port is cleared (indefinitely, if such is the case,
   notifying user there is issue with rig).
  * I am doing this, because there is a growing issue with latest miners having
    ports hang in linux- This is developer issues of miners themselves. 
    This way can go to developers and let them know their miners won't 
    close ports properly on exit.

  -T-Rex updated
  -TeamRedMiner updated, x16 algos added.
  -xmrig amd updated
  -xmrig nvidia updated (windows, need to compile for linux still).
  -xmrstak updated.

  -Added more to ``vars`` parameter for modules.
  -Wiki was updated.


  2.4.0

  Note- This is beta version from beta_testing branch

   GUIDED HELP
   * There are four different ways to start guided help:
     * run command ``swarm_help`` after SWARM has started in HiveOS/Windows
     * [Linux] Run sudo ./help.sh (will install SWARM first, then run help)
     * [Windows] Run Help.bat
     * [ALL] opening either SWARM.bat or ./swarm, and adding ``-help``
   * Will allow users to set up a basic configuration
   * After basic config is created, will allow users to modify advanced settings.
   * Everything is guided, and additional information beyond help.txt is supplied.
   * Guided help will save your configuration to newarguments.json, as well as
     provide a copy/paste of arguments for flighsheets/configs.

    NEW ARGUMENTS!

  ``-TypeBanCount``

  Like PoolBanCount,MinerBanCount, and AlgoBanCount, TypeBanCount will take
  action if a device type (AMD1,CPU,NVIDIA1,etc.) has x consecutive banned
  miners in a row- Where x is -TypeBanCount. When x has been reached, SWARM
  will reset all timeouts, then restart computer.

  ``-TCP_IP``
   Default is 127.0.0.1. Sets IP for tcp api.

   -NEW FEATURES!

  -Removed CoreInfo for AES detection
  -Better GPU detection (windows)
   * Lists Correct VRAM
   * AMD lists vbios version
   * AMD lists memory vendor

  -Fixed issue if more than one active logfile was present

  -Code staging for a guided step-by-step tutorial to set up SWARM.

  -SWARM should display a message is a miner was skipped over due to ``-threshold``

  -Per user request- Removed FancyIX's suggest settings for mtp (-p 0,strict,verbose,d=700)

  -Test-Path HiveOS oc log first to prevent error generation

  -``get active screen`` displays differently
   * removed "Days", as it wasn't needed.
   * added "#", which is the instance number
   * ordered by instance- Greatest (most recently ran miners) to least.

  -Improved CPU metrics (Windows)

  -TCP api now shows "WorkerName"

  -fixed html api (I didn't notice I broke it. It is restored).

  -There was a rare issue in windows when the background script controlloing active miner
   would crash. This would result in the SWARM launching a new miner while
   the active miner continued to run. When SWARM restarts/closes miners, it will now
   close all child process associated with that starting script. This includes if users added 
   pre-starting scripts. Linux - The screen window is closes, meaning all processes in that 
   screen are closed with it...Hence it is not needed.

  -Windows: It is common that if a miner card has crashed, the miner window will not close.
   if user specifies ``-Startup Yes`` (Default is Yes), SWARM will restart computer after
   2 minutes of the window staying open. It will notify HiveOS this is the case.

  -xmrig linux update
  -xmr-stak linux updated
  -cpuminer updated (note- avx2 only!!)
  -cc-mtp updated
  -nminer updated
  -teamredminer updated

     NEW FEATURES!

    -Windows: Hashrate Watchdog in HiveOS now works!
     * LA reboot is not working- coming soon.
    
    -Windows: Push Interval works on HiveOS.

    -Windows: GPU watchdog works on HiveOS.
     * If a GPU shows a temperature of 0,
       SWARM reboots computer

    -Windows: Miner Delay works on HiveOS.
     * SWARM starts, but goes to sleep.

    -HiveOS: Auto-Upgrade of pwsh to 6.2.0

    -SWARM will now save version of miner to
    swarm-version.txt in bin folder of miner.

    -if version in swarm-version.txt and update.json
     are a mismatch- SWARM will download miner to
     latest version.
    
    -Version checking is useuful for users cloning
     SWARM rather than downloading new version.
    
    -Wildrig updated
    -gminer updated

    FIXES

    -There was a bug with oc-tuning for SWARM that was causing it to not start.
     This version fixes.
     
    -Fixed culture info of datetime errors.

    -Windows 7/8: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6561
     fixed -wait parameter issues- Known powershell bug.
    
    -Windows ASIC: Prevent GPU-detection from running if only ASIC specified.

        -``version update`` commmand for Windows is now
      working again. Tested it repeatedly. It still
      works for linux. To use:

      ``version update [miner name] [version number] [download uri]``
       (Still must be a direct download, Mega will not work)

      If you are unsure of the denoted name SWARM uses for miner-
      use the ``version query`` command.

    -For All_Altwallets
     * Since your mining the coin directly, mc= / zap= is not needed .
     * SWARM will now remove the mc= / zap= .

    -``swarm_help`` in linux was glitching out during selection of
     advanced paramters- Fixed.


    # SWARM 2.4.4

    NOTE: Wallet.json has changed, because of this- your old wallets.json will
    not transfer on update. You will have to fill out new wallet.json.

    ## New features!
    * Windows: Added -Hive_Hash to Windows_Help.bat
    * SWARM will close miners before updating new version
     (mainly fixes windows "file is in use" potential error).
    * If user has nicehash as only pool- Donate pool becomes nicehash.
    * SWARM will remove optional miners when not specified.
    * Lyraz330 algorithm added
    * Windows: SWARM will show .json sent to HiveOS for stats.
    * NEW wallet.json
      * easier to understand.
      * allows solo mining settings.
      * allows auto-exchange settings with solo mining.
      * admin wallet settings added
      * note: As before- All arguments have a higher precedence.
        * If you set -Admin_fee, SWARM will ignore admin in .json
        * If you set -Altwallet1, SWARM will ignore all altwallet settings.
        * This is so you can remotely force "remove" settings if need be.

    ## NEW arguments!
    * ``-Admin_Fee``
        [0-50] Percentage
        Admin_Fee allows users to set a seperate wallet, and specify
        a certain percentage of time mined on that wallet a day. Admin
        Mode is done first, and then normal mode begins. Every 24 hours-
        Admin_Mode starts again, mining % of day specified by this parameter.
        If SWARM enters donation mode, time is either added to Admin_Fee, or
        removed, to encompass an even distribution between admin mode and user mode.
        Simple timestamp of when last Admin ran occurred will be
        placed in ".\admin" folder for reference. They will be transferred on update.
        ``-Admin`` must be specified if using ``-Admin_Fee``

    * ``-Admin``
        Admin Wallet for ``-Admin_Fee`` Parameter
    * ``-Admin_Pass`` Password symbol for ``-Admin``
        Default is "BTC"

    ## FIXES:
    * oc tuning between website and local is fixed- OC tuning can now
      interchange between website and local oc.
      * note: HiveOS can only do group 1 (AMD1/NVIDIA1)
      * SWARM can do all device groups, so you can combine both, but
        it will skip over group 1 if it is was done already through site.
      * You can set SWARM oc to use as a backup in case website oc fails.
        * At least the default oc, so you don't crash cards because web oc failed.
    * SWARM will stop miners before updating miner if new version
      is detected in update.json. This prevents access-denied errors.
    * Added internal parameters to $(vars) parameter for modules.
    * Fixed issues in which SWARM did not stats fans/temps/power in
      Windows version (HiveOS agent).
    * Weird parsing of wallets happening with -Coin argument. Was fixed.

    ## UPDATES:
    * Wildrig updated
    * cc-mtp updated
    * cpuminer updated
    * Lyraz330 added
    * t-rex updated
    * cc-mtp updated
    
    2.4.5

    ## FEATURES

    * All major variables for core program are now
      contained in $(vars) variable.
    * Add new functions to add/remove/check variables
      for modules (see swarm.ps1 for description).
    * SWARM will now try to 'guess' miner binary downloads,
      when the link doesn't end with the package name.
      * example: https://mybadassminer.com/download
        * SWARM will assume this is a .zip or 7z if windows.
        * SWARM will assume this is a tar.gz if linux.
    * ``version update`` command was edited so that
        links can contain special characters.
        * example: https://mybadassminer.com/&getdownloads_1=&download_8008135
          * The '&' would previously break ``version update`` command.
          * This works if you the url is between quotes (' ')
            example: ``version update cc-awesome 1.0.0 'https://mybadassminer.com/&getdownloads_1=&download_8008135'``
    * Remove certification checks for github, and some other sites- This may Help
      issues with users who's internet connection is not so great download miners.
        
    ## FIXES (from beta release)
    * When SWARM restarts loop (no miners! error, bad download, etc.), it
      will not remove all previous variables, preventing dictionary errors.
    * There was a typo for Windows AMD overclocking in beta version for
      core voltage - Fixed.
    * Reduced GPU Watchdog sensitivity from the first time it fails to displays
      temps, to 10 times in a row it must fail to display temps before restart.
    * Beta version- Coin miners would load, even when Auto_Coin wasn't specified:
      was resolved.
    * Beta version - Error output was missing in logs. This was fixed.

      * Shows number of timeouts on miner in past hour.
      * Clears count of bad benchmarks on miner after hour
        of it working fine.
      * Ban for Miner to HiveOS now shows Miner:Type.

    ## FIXES
    * Exit Reason 1 error: Fixed.
    * Fixed linux ``version query``
    * Fixed nvidia-smi.exe issue for Windows.
       * SWARM will install it.
    * HiveOS changed web methods, causing issues

  but all miners that require binaries now. So you can
  monitor downloading.
* typo in bminer on windows side- Added 'export LD_LIBRARY'
  from linux side, didn't cause any issues, but fixed
  to prevent error.

## Fixes
* Wallets.json full depth was not being covertedto-Json on update.
  This is resolved.
* Wallets.json "Add another coin here" was getting added on occasion
  to arguments as c=, causing certain miners to fail- This was resolved.

## Updates
* Wildrig_Multi (windows only release) 
  * glt-globalhash not added HiveOS yet. Did not add to SWARM.
    Very complicated to add one algorithm for Windows, but not Linux.

## New Features!
* cuckaroo29d support
* added color and formatting to new miner list
  on main screen.
* chmod +x miners before starting them (in case

# SWARM 2.5.4

Notes: At the time of this release, there was
issues with grin network/nicehash. If you experience
issues- It is network related.

## New Features!
* ASIC improvements:
  * ASIC miners on main screen listed
    by designated nickname
  * background agent lists hashrates
    for each ASIC.
* Port Checking
 * SWARM will now only attempt to run
   ``killcx`` for 10 seconds. If it
    continues to fail: It stops and
    moves on, printing a lesser warning.
    In most cases, this will not harm
    api and hashrate gathering.
* Agent improvements:
  * Agent will now wait until ALL
    miner groups have launched/switched,
    before it continues to query API.

## Fixes
* miniz miner was not downloading correctly with last
  miner download change- Fixed.
* bmw512 was not loading when you updated- Fixed.
  both x14 and bmw512 should work via remote update.

## Adjustments
* zergpool hashrate volume is measured by
  hashrate_shared, and not hashrate (both shared and solo).
  Should slightly improve ``-Volume`` argument.

# SWARM 2.5.5

Notes: SWARM will continue to update miners. If you
have issues, you can use the remote command ``version update``
to roll them back.

## New features!
* CPU miner for cpupower added.

## Fixes
* Noticed last change with port clearing caused killcx
  to get 'stuck' in background- fixed. Should Reduced
  cpu load by 5%

## Updates
* Wildrig Windows updated
* xmrig cpu updated
* jayddee cpu updated
* bminer updated
* Phoenix miner updated.
* Swarm-Miner updated to version 1.03
  * Slighly better optimizations for RTX
    card performance
* SWARM will send nofitication for 
  incompatible mega.nz links.
* SWARM notifies how to clear bans.
* tt-miner updated (beta test version)
  * still optional.
* Adjusted nlpool mbtc_mh_factor.

# SWARM 2.5.6 (beta)

## Old Arguments Removed!
* ``-Stat_all`` is no longer needed. Do not use.
* ``-Ban_GLT`` default is now "No". (was "Yes").

## New Arguments! (beta)
* ``-Historical_Bias``   [0-100]   Expressed as Percentage. 
  * Will only affect Auto_Algo.
  * Will not affect niechash or whalesburg.
  * This if for users who ONLY want coins that historically
    turn a profit. However, the drawback is that you may
    avoid profitable coins due to bad luck streaks.
  * You may completely different algorithms at the
    top of the list using this parameter, depending on
    how high you set the bias.
  * Historical_Bias bias does two things:
    * Reduces algorithms that have no 24h returns by 100%
    * Compares the deviation between 24hr estimates and 24hr
      returns into a %, and then creates a EMA with each
      value. (for smoothing). SWARM then applies a bonus/penality
      to the algorithm based on how well it has performed
      over time historically. SWARM will only apply a % penality
      or bonus of x%, where x is -Historical_Bias figure.
      Deviations will be listed in stat files.
      If you use, reccommended starting values are somewhere
      around 25-35% historical bias.

## Updates
* Pool files were heavily changed/updated to increase
  speed, and add new features.
* Nicehash file updated to new platform (You require a
  new account and update from old nicehash platform).
* nanominer update (warning: users were stating in linux
  it was failing, though settings were correct. Contact dev
  if that is the case.
* t-rex updated
* new equihash algos added.

## Fixes:
* Pool files were updated/fixed, and tested individually.
  * Note: If you recieve a fairly high estimate, notify
    pool that their mbtc_mh_factor is incorrect for that
    item. Please let me know if you spot any bugs.
* Prevent agent in Windows from locking up if you close
  main screen while "waiting for miners to start"
  message appears.

# SWARM 2.5.9

## New Parameters!

* ``-Time_Wait`` Default is 10 seconds.
               For linux version only.
               The maximum amount of time
               SWARM will continue to 
               clear miner API ports,
               before continuing on.

* ``-Coin_params`` See SWARM_help.txt for usage.
                 Is meant to allow remote change
                 of wallets.json for solo mining
                 or direct mining of coins.


## Updates!

  From Last Release's
  changes with pool.

############################################

# SWARM 2.6.3

## CRITICAL UPDATE
* Fixes first time load of pool stats
  For ``-Auto_Coin``
* This is only for users with ``Auto_Coin``
  You can ignore if not using.

############################################

# SWARM 2.6.4

## Fixes
* Resolved issues with Windows ``get update``
  * Should now work from this version forward.
* Fixed some more pool issues- Everything
  should be resolved now.

## Updates
* HiveOS SWARM will now write newarguments.json
  on startup- For future use. You will see
  "New arguments detected message- This is normal."

############################################
############################################

# SWARM 2.6.5

## New Command! [Highly Expiremental]
* ``swarm_batch``
  * Will only work if you are using
    ``-API_Key`` argument
  * Allows users to run a command that
    will run on all rigs in farm running
    SWARM.
  * Example: ``swarm_batch clear_profits``
    * will run ``clear_profits`` on all
      rigs.
  * The issue is, is that HiveOS API
    was not working for me. I could 
    only get "reboot" command to work.
    I notified web dev, and command is created
    for when their API is working correctly. 
    If you would like it working- try command 
    and post your output to developers. It will 
    output the .json sent to their API.

## Improvements
* Force bind onboard card to first on list
  * Caviet- If gpu crashes and drivers reload
    It will change the order in Windows.
* If no GPU cards are detected- SWARM should
  default cpu mine, and auto detect -CPUthreads.
* Improved windows output on HiveOS connect failure.

## Updates
* Removed lolminer equihash_150/5
* Updated lolminer
* Updated miniz
* Updated tt-miner
* Updated Bminer
* Claymore updated

## Notes
* If you experience errors after updating-
  Run ``clear_profits``. I have changed
  stat files over time.

# SWARM 2.6.6

## Fixes
* This fixes the new ``swarm_batch`` command.
  There was an issue with syntax I wasn't aware
  of. It should now be able to run any SWARM
  command, and do so on all workers running
  SWARM if ``-API_Key`` is supplied. You
  just run through shell or can do
  through command dashboard.

############################################
############################################

# SWARM 2.6.7

## Improvements
* Heavily cleaned up web methods for
  Windows HiveOS. Simplified codebase.
* Added ``swarm_batch`` command to Windows.
  * Alredy in HiveOS version.
  * Allows you to send command to one rig,
    which will execute that command on all
    rigs in that farm running SWARM.
    * Example:
      * ``swarm_batch get stats``
         All rigs running SWARM in your
        farm will all simulatenously
        run ``get stats``
      * This should work with most native
        HiveOS commands as well, but will
        only run on rigs running SWARM. I
        can't gurantee or support this- Just
        SWARM specific commands.
  * Requires using ``-API_Key argument``

* created ``miner stop|start|restart|log``
  commands that can run locally on Windows
  version. (Note- ``miner stop`` does not
  close agent, just stops SWARM``), so you
  can still communicate with HiveOS

# SWARM 2.6.8  -- beta 1

Note: This is 1 of 2 new upcoming beta releases
to test new Expiremental features.

## New Features!
* Autofan for HiveOS now works in Windows!
  * This is a expiremental beta implementation
    please notify if you have issues.
* AMD Memtweak settings from HiveOS added
  to OC in Windows.
* ``swarm_batch`` can accept -windows or -linux
    to specify specific OS.
    * example:
      * ``swarm_batch get stats -linux``
        * Will only run ``get stats`` in linux rigs.

## Updates
* Gminer - added 125/4 for AMD.
* Bminer

## Fixes
* Made it so you don't have to enters
  Hive_Hash every time you run ``swarm_help``.
* Fixed typo in nvidia oc, which caused an issue
  if you set a singular value for one oc, but multiple
  values for another in HiveOS.
* Fixed/updated install.ps1/install.sh
  * wolfamdctrl symlink error fix.
  * ./help.sh guided help start fix. (path moved).
  * typo with $dir path in one of the install transfers.
* Adjusted nvidia oc Pl to work as watts, not % in Windows
  * This means it matches HiveOS's website interface.

# SWARM 2.7.0

## Guided Help
* Windows: Run SWARM.bat
* Linux: Run ./swarm
* HiveOS: Specify SWARM as custom miner
  * extra config arguments no longer mandatory.
* SWARM should now run guided help
on first launch if no arguments
are specified. Simply answer the
very simple questions, and you
are mining!

## Updates
* gminer 1.66
* tt-miner moved from optional to
  regular miner in linux.
* tt-miner updated
* teamredminer updated
* z-enemy updated
* t-rex updated
* SWARM is x16rv2 ready
* xmrig (cpu) updated.

## Fixes
* Found bug regarding auto-restart
  after 10 bad intervals- It was
  resolved. Should migrate backups,
  clear, bans, and automatically restart
  if 10 consecutive bad intervals of no hash.
* Some mismatched algo names in teamredminer config.
  Is now fixed.

## What's New?
* Shortened "cryptonight" to "cnight" to
  help with fitting stats on screen.
* ``get stats`` will sort device groups by name.
* nlpool divisor is no correct on some algos-
  manually adjusted them until fixed.

# SWARM 2.7.2

## Guided Help
* Windows: Run SWARM.bat
* Linux: Run ./swarm
* HiveOS: Specify SWARM as custom miner
  * extra config arguments no longer mandatory.
* SWARM should now run guided help
on first launch if no arguments
are specified. Simply answer the
very simple questions, and you
are mining!

## What's New?
* Made it so that arguments.json is ALWAYS
  overidden by newarguments.json. arguments.json
  is local config, while newarguments.json is a config
  created either by guided help or remotely (HiveOS).
* Force initial params to be user_params. In some rare
  circumstances if you ran guided help, it would load
  defaults initially (must have taken a specific course
  of action). user_params are now force overidden by default.
* ``-CPUthreads`` param is not overidden if leaving SWARM to autodetect
  system (no ``-Type`` parameter used).
* added sample of adding args to ./swarm and ./swarm.bat,
  since initial arguments are removed (to initiate guided help).

## Updates
* TeamRedMiner x16rv2 added.
* tt-miner

## Fixes
* Desktop for Windows to add a SWARM_Terminal link will be
  set, even if user is using one drive.
* Removed Nvidia table-add error if cpu mining only
