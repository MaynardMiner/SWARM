# SWARM 3.2.9

## What's New?
* New Parameter -Hashrate_Threshold
* Set at default 10
* Will prevent switching from one miner to another
  on the same algorithm.
* Example: You are mining ethash with bminer. All
  other miners that can mine ethash in that device
  group will have their factored hashrate be reduced
  by x%, where x is -Hashrate_Threshold. This means
  a non-active miner must be x% faster than current
  miner in order for a switch to that miner to occur.
* This allows accurate hashrate factoring, while preventing
  constant switching of miners with the same algorithm.

## Improvements
* Fixed small typos created from last release/code cleanup.
* get help command was updated with proper commands and usages.
* Updated swarm_help with new parameter.
* Prevent benchmark right after miner was downloaded.
