# SWARM 3.3.2

## Improvements
* Self-Update (HiveOS version): Added cuda 11 libs. Should auto-update libs. Other *nix version run ./install_linux;
* Updated bminer.ps1 miner file.
* New LOGGING method. Should real-time log errors with time stamps. This is expiremental: Does not affect SWARM, just its logs.
* Updater Patch: Last version updater would try to update itself (hah). This fixes.
* Updater Patch: Updater will not try to update a .git repository version of swarm (just pull).
