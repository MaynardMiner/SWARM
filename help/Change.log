# Version 3.6.0

## Beta Release
* This project has all basic miners, but need more miners and updates.

## Important Note!
* AMD requires clinfo installed. `apt-get install clinfo` will install it in linux.
* If the above is too confusing, use -Opencl [AMD Platform]

## Improvements 
* Fixed OpenCl
* miniz added.
* gminer amd added.
* lolminer added- SPECIAL NOTE: Will only work for NVIDIA1 due to api. Will only work for AMD1 if using AMD and NVIDIA.
* neoscrypt added back in (Saw high on Whattomine.com)

## KNOWN ISSUES
* Get Wallets not working.
* More miners are coming soon.

## Suggested Settings- What I as the Dev use.
* -Auto_Coin Yes (use coin for calculations when applicable)
* -Stat_Coin live (Mine based on individual coin statistics live values)
* -Stat_Algo Live (Use live data for algorithms)
* -Min_Blocks 4 (Don't mine anything that is going to take more than 6 hours to find)
* -historical_bias 1:1 (Don't penalize based on historical data- Too much new activity now)
* -Hashrate_Threshold 10 (Don't switch miner on same algorithm unless it falls below 10% hashrate of next best miner)
* -Switch_Threshold 5 (Don't switch unless next profitable item is at least 5% better)
