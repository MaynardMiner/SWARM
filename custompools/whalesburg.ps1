## Note on whalesburg.
## This pool is supposed to be a profit switching pool.
## I have never seen it switch.
## SWARM does not perform the switching, the pool does.
## Also,

## Miners are really weird with this pool. Some miners work
## Some do not. Some work in linux fine, other work in windows
## fine. I don't know the difference this pool causes in comparision
## to nicehash, but it seems to cause weird bugs in miners.
